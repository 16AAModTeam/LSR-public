# The 16AA's public mods

This repository is the home of the [16AA](https://16aa.net)'s public modifications for ArmA 3. Contributions are very welcome.

We have a large number of private mods we run for ourselves. We'd like to make as many of these public as possible, but it might take a while.

# Building

1. Install [hemtt](https://github.com/synixebrett/HEMTT/releases) on your PATH (if you're unsure, you probably want ...x86_65-pc-windows-msvc).
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `hemtt build`
4. Add this folder as a mod to ArmA 3 as you would normally.
5. Start ArmA 3!
