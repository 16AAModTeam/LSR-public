# The 16AA's public mods

This repository is the home of the [16AA](https://16aa.net)'s public modifications for ArmA 3. Contributions are very welcome.

We have a large number of private mods we run for ourselves. We'd like to make as many of these public as possible, but it might take a while.

We try to make everything as modular as possible. If you don't want a PBO, just delete it.

# What does it do?

- Replace CUP buildings with their equivalents from the Livonia terrain - i.e. more buildings with interiors on Chernarus, etc.
